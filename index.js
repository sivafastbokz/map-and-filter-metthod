// filter()
// The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. 
//The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify 
//certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.

// map()
// The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. 
//The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, 
//returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array.

//The filter method doesn't do the same as the map method. 
//The map method is used to convert each item of an array, 
//while the filter method is used to select certain items of an array.
